      Answer:
      If I had more time I would have done this website responsive for mobile view too.
      And also done the second and third coloumn 1:1 for image. As I tried my best to find solution for both.
      

2)How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

        Answer: 
        Clean up your website's code. Remove unnecessary elements such as white spaces, comments and inline spacing.
        Check your PHP version. 
        MySQL Server: Find slow-executing queries. 
        Analyze slow website content. 
        Speed up your site performance.
        Check your content.
